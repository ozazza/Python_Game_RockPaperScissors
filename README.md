# Python_Game_RockPaperScissors
> Python Fundamentals Practical project

A simple console game, where you and the computer simultaneously
choose one of the following three options: "rock", "paper", or "scissors".

#### Rules
- Rock beats scissors (the scissors get broken by the rock)
- Scissors beats paper (the paper gets cut by the scissors)
- Paper beats rock (the paper covers the rock)

The winner is the player whose choice exceeds that of his opponent.
If both players choose the same option, the result of the game is a "tie".

#### Play
